Food Delivery App (FlutterFlow + Firebase)
Overview
The Food Delivery App is designed to connect users with local restaurants, allowing them to browse menus, place orders, and track deliveries in real-time. This app is built using FlutterFlow, a no-code development tool that generates Flutter code, with Firebase serving as the backend for authentication, database, cloud storage, and real-time functionalities.

Features
Browse Restaurants: Users can discover local restaurants, filter by cuisine, distance, and ratings.
Place Orders: Choose dishes, customize orders, and complete the checkout process with integrated payment gateways.
Real-Time Order Tracking: Users can track their orderâ€™s status from restaurant preparation to delivery.
Push Notifications: Get notified about order updates, new promotions, and offers.
User Profiles: Save addresses, favorite restaurants, and payment methods for quick access.
Secure Payments: Payments integrated with Stripe (or another supported gateway via Firebase functions).
Restaurant Management Panel: A separate admin interface for restaurants to manage their menus, orders, and delivery options.
Technology Stack
Frontend: Flutter (generated via FlutterFlow)
Backend: Firebase (Authentication, Firestore Database, Cloud Functions, Firebase Storage)
Real-Time Database: Firestore
Push Notifications: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)
Payments: Stripe (or another payment integration via Firebase Functions)
Geolocation Services: Google Maps API for restaurant discovery and order tracking

Google Maps API key for geolocation services.
Stripe account (or other payment gateway) for payment processing.
Setup Instructions
Clone or Import Project:

Import the FlutterFlow project from the shared project link (if provided).
Or clone the repository if you have access to the code.
Firebase Setup:

Go to your Firebase Console and create a new project.
Enable Firebase Authentication, Firestore Database, Firebase Storage, Firebase Cloud Messaging, and Cloud Functions in your Firebase project.
In FlutterFlow, go to Settings > Firebase and connect your app to the Firebase project using your Firebase configuration.
Configure Firebase:

Download the google-services.json (for Android) and GoogleService-Info.plist (for iOS) from Firebase and add them to your FlutterFlow project.
In FlutterFlow, navigate to Settings > Authentication to set up Firebase Auth (Google, Facebook, or email login).
Google Maps API:

Go to the Google Cloud Console and create an API key.
Enable Google Maps API for geolocation and order tracking.
In FlutterFlow, go to Settings > API Keys and add your Google Maps API key.
Stripe Integration (or other payment gateway):

Set up Stripe in your Firebase Functions to handle payments.
Add your Stripe API keys to Firebase Functions or via environment variables in Firebase.
Run the App:

In FlutterFlow, click on Run or export the code and use flutter run in your local environment to see the app in action.
bash
Copy code
flutter run
Deployment
Build for iOS/Android:

In FlutterFlow, use the Build feature to generate APK/IPA files for your app.
Follow the standard instructions for deploying apps to Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
Firebase Hosting (Web):

If deploying a web version, use Firebase Hosting to serve your app.

Run the following commands to deploy:

bash
Copy code
flutter build web
firebase deploy --only hosting
